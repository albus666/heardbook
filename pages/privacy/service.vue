			<div class="title">2. HeardLy's Services and Rights</div>
			<div class="content">1.HeardLy provides the key insights from non-fiction books, articles and other content
				(e.g., the "books-in-blinks" or “articles-in-blinks”, hereinafter jointly referred to as ”Platform
				Content”), which allow you to grasp their essence within a few minutes. Moreover, HeardLy may provide a
				personal profile to you, which you can fill with your preferred platform content and text markers as
				well as
				sorting this content into different categories and lists. In addition, you can purchase audiobooks and
				other
				premium audio content (“Audiobook Content”) on the Platform.<br><br>2.The extent of the platform Content
				and
				the
				options to use (the “License”) depend on the type of account you selected. There is a difference between
				a
				free account (see Section 3), a paid subscription (see Section 4) and a free trial (see Section 5) and a
				purchase of Audiobook Content (see Section 6). In terms of duration, the license is limited to the
				validity
				period of the free account / paid subscription / free trial, however, in case of a purchase of Audiobook
				Content availability in your account will be, subject to Section 6, unlimited.<br><br>3.The rights to
				HeardLy's
				service and the content distributed through the service are and will remain with HeardLy and /or
				HeardLy's
				licensors. The HeardLy software applications and content are licensed to you within the scope of the
				contractual use. We only grant you a non-exclusive (simple), time-limited right to personal use of the
				HeardLy service and its contents (however, subject to Section 6, availability of purchased Audiobook
				Content will be unlimited in your account).<br><br>4.All HeardLy trademarks as well as our trade names,
				logos,
				domain names and other distinctive features of the HeardLy trademark are the sole property of HeardLy.
				The
				license does not give you any right to use the HeardLy trademarks, our trade names, logos, domain names
				or
				any other distinctive features of the HeardLy trademark, be it for commercial or non-commercial
				purposes.<br><br>5.If you do not use a paid service, HeardLy is allowed to show you promotional
				information
				on
				the Platform.</div>
			<div class="title">3. Registering with HeardLy</div>
			<div class="content">1.In order to be able to use HeardLy’s services, a registration with HeardLy is
				required. Individuals over the age of 18 have the right to register. As a minor, you may only register
				with
				HeardLy if you are at least 14 years old and your legal representatives have provided their consent.
				HeardLy reserves the right to make the use of HeardLy services contingent on proper proof of your
				identity, your legal age, or your legal representative’s consent.<br><br>2.The registration itself is
				free
				of charge (free account) and does not oblige you to obtain a paid subscription. By registering, you are
				executing an agreement with HeardLy for a limited, free use of the Platform.<br><br>3.You can use your
				e-mail address as well as a password of your choice to register. Alternatively, you may register using a
				single sign-on service (for example, Apple ID login). You can register via our website or after
				downloading
				our iOS or Android apps.<br><br>4.Any information required for registration must be complete
				and correct and always up-to-date. HeardLy has the right to save and process the data you provided
				during
				registration, in accordance with the provisions on Data Protection.<br><br>5.The password used must be
				kept
				confidential. Keeping it a secret is solely and fully your responsibility. The HeardLy user account may
				only be used by you. Any unauthorized use of your user account, as well as any such suspicion to that
				effect
				should be communicated to HeardLy immediately.</div>
			<div class="title">4. Executing an Agreement for a Paid Subscription</div>
			<div class="content">1.To be able to fully benefit from HeardLy's services, additional service packages in
				the
				form of paid subscriptions (“Subscription Access”) are available to you after registering. These can be
				purchased for different, and variable periods of time, which you will see in the order
				options.<br><br>2.HeardLy's Subscription Accesses are ad-free, paid subscriptions that allow you to
				access
				additional content and features through our mobile and web-based applications. We currently offer the
				following subscription / service package:<li>The HeardLy Premium service package includes ad-free access
					to
					all of our Platform Content in both text and audio.</li>You will have access to the respective
				services
				as long as your
				subscription is valid.<br><br>3.You submit a legally binding offer for a fee-based subscription, if you
				enter the information requested in the online order form and then click on the “Order with obligation to
				pay” button. By doing so, you submit a legally binding offer for an agreement for a paid subscription.
				Before submitting your order, you may change and div the data at any time.<br><br>4.The contract is
				concluded when HeardLy issues a notice of acceptance (order confirmation), which will be sent to you by
				email within a reasonable time. If you purchased your fee-based subscription via HeardLy’s web-based
				application HeardLy will send the order confirmation to you by email together with the receipt
				confirmation
				immediately following your order. If you purchased your fee-based subscription via an in-app purchase
				(please also see subsection 5) you will receive a receipt confirmation following your order from the
				third
				party appstore and HeardLy will send to you the notice of acceptance (order confirmation) by separate
				email. In both cases, the text of the contract (consisting of the order, the General Terms and
				Conditions
				and the order confirmation) will be sent to you by HeardLy on a permanent data carrier (email) (contract
				confirmation). Your subscription begins on this date. The text of the agreement is saved subject to data
				protection. Please read our Privacy Statement for information on the collection, use and processing of
				your
				data.<br><br>5.You can also sign up for a paid subscription through an in-app purchase through our iOS
				or
				Android apps. In order to do this, you must select the desired option on the subscription screen within
				the
				app, and a pop-up will appear where you have to enter your password for the third party appstore. As
				soon as
				you finish, a pop-up will appear in which you have to confirm the purchase of the subscription again. At
				this point you can still cancel the process. You should then receive a receipt confirmation from the
				third
				party appstore (not directly from HeardLy).</div>
			<div class="title">5. Trials/ Testing Phases</div>
			<div class="content">1.HeardLy occasionally offers in particular to new users free Subscription Access for
				testing purposes for a certain period of time (“Trial”). HeardLy determines, at its sole discretion, if
				you
				may participate in a Trial. In case of an important reason, HeardLy may discontinue or change such free
				Trial at any time without prior notice or notification.<br><br>2.You can only participate in certain
				Trials
				if you enter your payment details when you sign up for the Trial. In such a case, we need your consent
				at
				the beginning of the Trial that your free access will be converted into a paid Subscription Access
				(Section
				4) on the day following the end of the Trial. In this situation, your subscription renews itself on a
				recurring basis and can be terminated up to one day before the end of the respective subscription period
				(Section 8.2).<br><br>3.If, in a case of Section 5.2 , you do not wish to have the Subscription Access
				and
				the charge associated with it, you must cancel your Subscription Access given to you during the Trial
				before
				the end of the Trial (for example, by simply going to your HeardLy Account Settings or the respective
				app
				store settings).</div>
			<div class="title">6. Audiobooks and Credits</div>
			<div class="content">1.If you registered with HeardLy, HeardLy allows you to purchase Audiobook Content
				through the Platform. Purchases can be made on an à la carte basis. Paid Subscription Access is not
				necessary in order to purchase Audiobook Content, however HeardLy will often offer more attractive
				pricing
				for Audiobook Content for customers who have Subscription
				Access.<br><br>2.You can also buy Audiobook Content through an in-app purchase through our
				iOS or Android apps. In order to do this, you must select the desired option on the purchase screen
				within
				the app where you have to log-in and confirm the purchase of the Audiobook Content. At this
				point you can still cancel the process. You should then receive a receipt confirmation from the third
				party
				appstore (not directly from HeardLy).<br><br>3.HeardLy reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
				change prices of audiobooks, at any time.<br><br>4.In the event HeardLy provided you with free
				Audiobook Content in connection with a Subscription Access, and you decide to cancel your Subscription
				Access, HeardLy may remove such free Audiobook Content granted in connection with Subscription Access
				from
				your HeardLy Library.<br><br>5.HeardLy in its absolute and sole discretion, reserves the right to refuse
				orders for Audiobook Content placed through the Platform, and – taking into account the particular
				circumstances of the case – in the event of fraud or abuse by a user, the right to temporarily block the
				access or to remove the Audiobook Content available in the library of that user.<br><br>6.When you
				purchase
				Audiobook Content, HeardLy grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable,
				non-sublicensable
				license to download such content to your HeardLy Library for your personal, non-commercial use. You are
				not
				entitled to alter, modify, sell, transfer, share, lease, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, copy,
				reproduce, duplicate, distribute, publicly perform, create derivative works from or otherwise
				commercially
				exploit the Audiobook Content or otherwise use and/or export the Audiobook Content outside the HeardLy
				Library. Any unauthorized transfer, duplication, or exploitation of any Audiobook Content constitutes
				copyright infringement, breach of contract, and potential other violations and liabilities, and is
				subject
				to civil and criminal penalties.<br><br>7.Purchased Audiobook Content will generally continue to be
				available in your "Library" but may become unavailable through no fault of HeardLy due to the unlikely
				event of potential new licensing restrictions of the content providers or other new requirements of the
				content providers. HeardLy will not be liable to you if Audiobook Content becomes unavailable for
				further
				download for such reasons.</div>
			<div class="title">7. Cancellation Policy</div>
			<div class="content">1.If you are a consumer (i.e., a person completing the legal transaction for purposes
				that
				can be predominantly attributed to neither their commercial nor their independent professional
				activity),
				you are entitled to a statutory withdrawal right when concluding a distance selling agreement, about
				which
				HeardLy provides information below in accordance with the statutory model. Please note that in the case
				of
				an in-app purchase, you have a right of withdrawal within the respective app store, i.e. Apple-App-Store
				or
				Google Play Store. A model withdrawal form can be found in Section 7.3.<br><br>
				- BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS ON WITHDRAWAL -<br><br>

				<br><br>To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning
				your
				exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.<br><br>
				Effects of withdrawal<br><br>
				If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received
				from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from
				your
				choice of a type of
				delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us) without undue delay and
				in
				any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw
				from
				this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the
				initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any
				fees
				as a result of such reimbursement.<br><br>
				If you requested to begin the performance of services during the
				withdrawal period, you shall pay us an
				amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated us your withdrawal
				from
				this contract, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.<br><br>
				- END INSTRUCTIONS ON WITHDRAWAL -<br><br>
				The right of withdrawal expires with regard to Audiobook Content contracts if the performance has begun
				(i.e. you downloaded the Audiobook Content to your HeardLy Library) with your prior consent before the
				end
				of the withdrawal period and your acknowledgment that you thereby lose your right of
				withdrawal.<br><br>
